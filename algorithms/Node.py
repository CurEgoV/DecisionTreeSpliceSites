'''
Object Node defines current state of a specified branch of the decision tree. It describes:
    --- attribute_pos --- the attribute position currently being considered
    --- split_condition_group --- set of the letters that was obtained after the split
    --- left_node --- further node on left side (meaning based of the split_condition_group letters)
    --- right_node --- further node on right side (meaning base of the negation split_condition_group letters)
